# Debugging

So this codelab was suuuper weird. It was ok until the end when it didn't actually work as expected.

Luckily, Stackoverflow exists and my buddies over there had my back, so now it actually does work as expected. 

Which, to say, is to crash. Which is what it was built for. Yeah. 

If you open this app it will just crash, basically.

Have fun!
